WP-CRM System is a WordPress CRM that is designed to work exclusively with YOUR WordPress site.

== Description ==
WP-CRM System is a fully featured WordPress CRM that allows you to use the WordPress interface you are already familiar with to manage your customers, projects, and tasks with ease.

Why spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a CRM that charges based on the number of records you have in your database, or the number of users that you have accessing your database? WP-CRM System allows you to have an unlimited number of records and lets you give everyone in your organization access to the WordPress CRM data they need to drive business.

**More than a CRM**

WP-CRM System allows your team to manage projects, assign individual tasks, track marketing campaigns, and helps convert your opportunities into successes!

Easily import contacts and other records from your old CRM with our easy to use CSV uploader.

Get email updates whenever a project or task you are assigned to is created or edited. Never miss a thing!

Quickly create new contacts from existing users on your site with just one click. The plugin will take existing information (name, email address, etc.) from the user's account and add it to the new contact in WP-CRM System.

**Assists with GDPR compliance**
WP-CRM System has optional features, which can assist with GDPR compliance if that is something your business requires. Please note that this plugin does not guarantee GDPR compliance as no plugin can provide 100% compliance. Compliance requires actions on the part of your business that this plugin cannot provide.

Available features include a way for your contacts to view the data that is stored on them in WP-CRM System, the ability for your contacts to export that data, and the ability for contacts to request that their data be deleted.

Not sure what GDPR is or if it applies to your business? [Read our blog post on GDPR](https://www.wp-crm.com/will-your-crm-be-gdpr-compliant/).

== Installation ==
1. Download archive and unzip in wp-content/plugins or install via Plugins - Add New.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What makes WP-CRM System different from other CRM's? =
Many other CRM's are hosted on the CRM company's servers, which requires you to maintain an active subscription in order to access YOUR data. WP-CRM System gives you control over your data by keeping it all contained on your WordPress CRM website. You own it all and no one can ever keep you from it - just like it should be. There are no expensive contracts required in order for you to access your customer's information.

= Can I Share Information With Customers? =
Sure! We have a [Client Area](https://www.wp-crm.com/downloads/client-area/?utm_source=extensions&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=client-area&utm_campaign=readme) add-on, which lets you assign projects, tasks, campaigns, and even invoices (with our [Invoicing](https://www.wp-crm.com/downloads/invoicing/?utm_source=extensions&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=invoicing&utm_campaign=readme) add-on) to your contacts. When your contact logs into their account, they'll be able to see everything you're working on for them.

If you need to show your contacts the data that you have on them for GDPR purposes, you will be able to use the GDPR settings to handle this without the need for any additional plugins.

= What if I am coming from another CRM, can I import my data? =
Absolutely. There are inexpensive extensions that allow you to import as little or as much information as you need to into your WordPress CRM.

= Is my data secure? =
Your data is only accessible through the WordPress CRM dashboard. None of it will be accessible through the public facing portion of your website unless you are using our GDPR features (see above). This allows you to provide access to as few or as many people as you need to.

= 2.6.7 =
* Updated datepicker fields to include the `autocomplete="off"` HTML attribute. This prevents browsers from displaying an autocomplete window on top of the datepicker calendar view.
= 2.6.6 =
* Added the ability to customize the datepicker via developer filters. See documentation for more details on how to modify the datepicker.
= 2.6.5 =
* Updated the WPCRM_System_Create class to include custom file fields, which have been introduced in the Custom Fields add-on.
= 2.6.4 =

= 2.6.3 =
* Corrected escaping output issues.
= 2.6.2 =
* Corrected escaping output issues.
= 2.6.1 =
* Update: Corrected the welcome screen to reflect current prices and brand assets.
= 2.6.0 =
* Enhanced: Reports are now filterable. Prior reporting was very static in that you could view a page with ALL projects assigned to ALL organizations. Now you can pick and choose what criteria you want to use in order to view the records that are most relevant to you.
* Fix: Email messages contained slashes in some cases.
* Fix: Errors were shown when attempting to send emails when required fields were empty.
* Update: Minimum recommended PHP version is 7.2, which follows WordPress standards. WP-CRM System will still work on PHP 5.6+, but it is recommended to users that they update to 7.2 if possible.
= 2.5.3 =
* Enhancement: Allows for searching on record fields instead of just record name. For example, a contact can be searched for by email, phone number, address, etc.
= 2.5.2 =
* Fix: Some data still not properly escaped for security purposes.
= 2.5.1 =
* Fix: Security vulnerabilities were discovered and corrected. Specifically, certain user input data from $_GET and $_POST variables were not properly sanitized.
= 2.5.0 =
* New: Introducing recurring Projects and Tasks. Create a project or task once, and have it automatically generate a new one after a given number of days, weeks, months, or years.

= 2.4.1 =
* Added upsell feature and minor improvements.
= 2.4.0 =
* New: Introduced features to integrate with the WordPress privacy tools included in WordPress version 4.9.6. Includes the ability to export or erase information on a contact when the contact's email address is entered into the export or erase tool in WordPress.

* New: Introduced features to allow users to more easily comply with GDPR rules. Those features include a way for your contacts to view the data that is stored on them in WP-CRM System, the ability for your contacts to export that data, and the ability for contacts to request that their data be deleted. **This plugin by itself does not guarantee GDPR compliance.**
* Change: register taxonomies on the plugins_loaded action rather than init as was done previously. This allows taxonomies to be exported in reports since the export is done around the setup_theme hook, which takes place prior to init.
= 2.2.7 =
* Fix: Variable $status used in WPCRM_System_Create for a new filter, which incorrectly caused the $status variable passed to the function to be overridden.
= 2.2.6 =
* Update: Provided filter `wpcrm_system_create_contacts_email_key_status`, which can be used to change the `post_status` value when searching for existing contacts by email address. Default value is `publish` as this is the default `post_status` value, which was used previously.
* Update: Provided filter `wpcrm_system_menu_name` to allow for whitelabeling of WP-CRM System's menu name. This filter allows for changing the name in the left menu.
* Update: Provided filter `wpcrm_system_menu_icon` to allow for changing the dashicon used in the menu next to WP-CRM System. By default the dashicon is `dashicons-id`.
= 2.2.5 =
* Update: Provided filter 'wpcrm_system_create-contacts_email_key' which should return true or false. False is default, and will cause contacts to be created or updated based on the contact's name. True would cause contacts to be created or updated based on the contact's email address.
* Add Zapier to list of extensions.
* Minor bug fixes.

* Minor update: Added new plugins to extensions page.
= 2.1.10 =
* Fix: Output of dates in certain circumstances would produce an error. Fix should prevent invalid dates from being displayed.
= 2.1.8 - 2.1.9 =

A record that is restored from trash will retain it's previous position as being linked to other records.
= 2.1.2 =
* Fix: If a name prefix (Mr, Mrs, etc.) was not set for a contact, "Select an Option" text would display before the name on the dashboard "Address Book" section.

= 2.0.24 =
* Improved: Select menus for Organizations, and other records would extend over items in adjacent columns if the text contained within was too long. Minor CSS fix limits the width of these select menus.
= 2.0.23 =
* Improved: Sending emails to contacts in WP-CRM System now saves the email in the contact's record.
